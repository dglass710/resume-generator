# Resume Generator Guide

Welcome to the Resume Generator! This guide will explain how to use the application, edit the data used for generating resumes, and understand key concepts like `master_resume`.

---

## **Using the GUI**

1. **Launch the Application**:
   - Run the executable file generated by PyInstaller. For example, `resume_generator.exe`.

2. **Navigate Through Sections**:
   - The GUI displays your resume content in sections like "Personal Information," "Objective," and "Core Competencies."
   - Use buttons or tabs in the interface to navigate between sections.

3. **Save or Export**:
   - Once you're satisfied with your resume content, use the export or save feature in the GUI (if implemented) to generate your resume in the desired format (e.g., PDF, Word).

## **Editing Resume Data**

The resume content is defined in `data.py` (or `default_data.py` if `data.py` is missing). These files contain a variable called `master_resume`, which is a **list** of sections. Each section includes the title, content, and other optional fields. 

### Key Points for Editing:
- `master_resume` is a **list** of **dictionaries**. Each dictionary represents a section of the resume.
- **Sections**:
  - `"title"`: The name of the section (e.g., "Personal Information").
  - `"content"`: A **list** of items representing the content in that section.

### **Examples:**

#### Personal Information Section
```python
{
    "title": "Personal Information",
    "content": [
        "Your Name",
        "City, State ZIP ⋄ Phone ⋄ Email ⋄ Website ⋄ GitHub ⋄ LinkedIn"
    ]
}
```
- You can update `"Your Name"` with your actual name.
- Modify other details like your location, phone, and LinkedIn URL.

#### Core Competencies Section
```python
{
    "title": "Core Competencies",
    "content": [
        "Skill 1",
        "Skill 2",
        "Skill 3"
    ]
}
```
- Replace `"Skill 1"`, `"Skill 2"`, etc., with your skills.
- Add or remove items as needed, ensuring they are comma-separated and that the last item does **not** have a trailing comma.

## **Key Concepts**

### **`master_resume`**
`master_resume` is a Python variable that holds all the resume data. It is structured as follows:
- **List**: Contains multiple dictionaries, each representing a section.
- **Dictionaries**: Each dictionary contains keys like `"title"`, `"content"`, and optional fields like `"subtitle"` or `"details"`.

Example:
```python
master_resume = [
    {
        "title": "Personal Information",
        "content": ["Your Name", "Contact Details"]
    },
    {
        "title": "Core Competencies",
        "content": ["Skill 1", "Skill 2"]
    }
]
```

### **Python Lists**
- Defined with square brackets `[]`.
- Items are separated by commas.
- Example:
  ```python
  ["item1", "item2", "item3"]
  ```

### **Python Dictionaries**
- Defined with curly braces `{}`.
- Contain key-value pairs separated by colons `:`.
- Example:
  ```python
  {
      "key1": "value1",
      "key2": "value2"
  }
  ```

## **Packing with PyInstaller**

To create an executable file:
1. **Install PyInstaller** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Generate the Executable**:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --name resume_generator resume_generator.py
   ```
   - The `--onefile` flag creates a single `.exe` file.
   - Replace `resume_generator.py` with the name of your main script.

3. **Distribute the Executable**:
   - Provide the `.exe` file along with `default_data.py` so users can customize the resume data.

---

## **Final Notes**

- Always maintain the structure of `master_resume` to ensure the program functions correctly.
- If you encounter issues, check for:
  - Missing commas.
  - Incorrect indentation.
  - Syntax errors in `data.py`.

Happy resume building!
